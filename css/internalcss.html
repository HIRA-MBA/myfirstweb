<h1> now we are learning internal css</h1>

<p> i am trying to learn internal css  as per requirement
    of my next quarter for react and next js
</p>

<p> today is 27 july 2024 weather is pleasent</p>

<p> now the problem is when we use hi{} we style all h1 in same style 
    we want all other h1 to look differnent we use class and ids.
</p>
<h2 class="red">class </h2>
<p> class are represent by " . " and we can use multiple classes at once</p>


<h2 id="green">id</h2>
<p> id are represent by "#" and are unique </p>
